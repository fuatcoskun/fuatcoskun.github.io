You probably know that there is a place far away called <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">"stackoverflow"</a> if you are here to read this blog post. Developers from every aspect of programming live here
and try to make scores, gain points & badges, complete some achievements. It is normal you think this is just a game due to many gamificated parts of it, but this is not.

You can see there is many job opportunities on the home page of stackoverflow and you can be sure many technology companies especially related to software development, consider stackoverflow scores of developers in addition to
theirs CV and other criterias. So, stackoverflow is a serious sharing/asking/discussion area which every level of developer can benefit from.

### Please up-vote and/or select one of the answers
Let's say you have posted a question and got 3 answers after a while. You saw that second answer is the point that you didn't realized about your issue. After 20 minutes then you have applied
the suggestion to your question, everything is working well. OK, close the stackoverflow page and just continue to your life and be happy.

No way! Please open your stackoverflow page, open questions tab and find the question you asked. Now, you should up-vote second answer and select it for showing
that this was the answer you expect and also this is the best answer for this question. So there are two happy people as you and the guy answered your question. Because he got
25 points for his/her answer.

### Don't forget that you have a post here...
You have posted a question about your issue and had a coffee break. You suddenly saw a light and found the answer you were looking for. Ok, quickly go and apply it
to your project, then forget it for ever.

This was the worst case! What if you found a solution that no one will be able to find and what if there are many people curious about the solution of your question? Here, you are the hero
and you should share your solution with others. You can be sure that your answer to your own question will be up-voted if it's really an important solution.

### Stackoverflow is not Google

If you want to get an answer to your question, first you should have a real question! Following examples show us they are not real questions : 

{% highlight bash %}
How to delete text file content in libgdx?
I am new in libgdx framework,so plese help me.
{% endhighlight %}

You should first read the documentation of the libgdx framework.

{% highlight bash %}
I want to develop a card game, is unity enough to do that?
{% endhighlight %}

Unity is enough to make any type of game, are you enough to develop ?

{% highlight bash %}
Are these libraries enough to develop an android application?
Otto-bus, Glide, dagger, mockito.
{% endhighlight %}

Oh yes, what is your next question?

Please don't think with your fingers! Firstly you should make an investigation on the web and need to be familiar that you wondering about. Then it's reasonable to
ask a question on stackoverflow.

### What did you try so far?

Please show your initial effort before asking a question about implementation of an algorithm. Show your code completely of partially if possible. At least, show
some pseudo code.

{% highlight bash %}
Is it possible to implement Beier-neely algorithm using java? 
Can you please show me some code?
{% endhighlight %}

Answer should be this:

{% highlight bash %}
Yes, it is possible.
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight java %}
import java.util.*;
{% endhighlight %}

### Where is your log?

I see some questions doesn't include any crash logs, stack traces, signal info or any information about the issue, exception. How can we know what is your problem without
looking to any logs? It is true that software developers have some special forces but you can be sure about they are not psychic or telepath. You should show some error logs about the problem you are facing.

I think stackoverflow will be a better place if we all can be careful while using it. 

Balian d'Ibelin says :

"Nemo vir est qui mundum non reddat meliorem"

Translation :

{% highlight bash %}
What man is a man who does not make the stackoverflow better?
{% endhighlight %}
