If you want to integrate Unity Ads into your native android project, but also don't want to use android library for some reason. I listed possible reasons of not using aar package in the following list.

- Not using Gradle build system.
- Using maven and facing issues while importing aar into your project.
- Want to add unity ads as library project.

First of all, you need to download <a href="https://github.com/Applifier/unity-ads-sdk/tree/master/unity-ads>"unity-ads</a> android library project under <a href="https://github.com/Applifier/unity-ads-sdk/tree/master/">unity-ads-sdk</a>
